# tol308g-assignment009-collisions

A sort-of-playable version of the classic arcade game.


HOMEWORK INSTRUCTIONS:

You have some "TODO"s to fill in again, particularly in:

spatialManager.js

But also, to a lesser extent, in:

Rock.js
Bullet.js
Ship.js


...Basically, you need to implement the core of the spatialManager,
and modify the Rock/Bullet/Ship to register (and unregister)
with it correctly, so that they can participate in collisions.

Be sure to test the diagnostic rendering for the spatialManager,
as toggled by the 'X' key. We rely on that for marking. My default
implementation will work for the "obvious" approach, but you might
need to tweak it if you do something "non-obvious" in yours.
